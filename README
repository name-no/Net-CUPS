Net::CUPS README
================

Net::CUPS is an interface to the Common Unix Printing System API.  
It follows most of the conventions set forth in the C API so anyone
who is familiar with it can easily get acquainted with Net::CUPS. 
The main deviation is the practice of converting the C structs
into Perl hashes for easy modification from a Perl application.

The Common Unix Printing System can be found at http://www.cups.org.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Please note that if you want to install only one of the modules that
you will have to copy the file 'typemap' to the individual directories
containing the modules you want to install or it will not compile 
correctly.  This practice is not recommended.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   *) Exporter::Cluster
   *) Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) - http://www.cups.org

The Makefile.PL will test for the version of the CUPS you have installed
and die if an appropriate version is not found.  This is due to the way
the module had to be coded to handle various variables and functions.
